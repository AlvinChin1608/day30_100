# day30_100
I am currently engaged in a 100-day Python Bootcamp, which I am documenting and sharing my progress on GitHub. The boot camp is designed to progressively intensify, allowing me to deepen my understanding and proficiency in Python programming.

Additionally, I have chosen to include the beginner, intermediate and advanced in my documentation to provide a valuable reference for my future growth and development.

## Password Manager Enchancements
The following enhancements have been made to the Password Manager project:

1. Switch from txt to JSON Format: Data is now stored in a JSON file, making it easier to manage and retrieve structured data.
2. Search Capability: Users can search for saved credentials by entering the website name, and the application will display the associated email and password.
3. Exception Handling: The application handles exceptions such as missing data files and non-existent entries gracefully, providing appropriate error messages to the user.
